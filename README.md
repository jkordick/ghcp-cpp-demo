# C++ Demo Project

This project demonstrates various bitwise operations in C++ using a simple console application. The project is designed to showcase the capabilities of GitHub Copilot in assisting with typical C++ tasks.

## Bitwise Operations Demonstrated
- **Bitwise AND** (`&`)
- **Bitwise OR** (`|`)
- **Bitwise XOR** (`^`)
- **Bitwise NOT** (`~`)
- **Bitwise Left Shift** (`<<`)
- **Bitwise Right Shift** (`>>`)

## Files
- `main.cpp`: The main C++ program file that demonstrates the bitwise operations.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project and instructions for running the demo.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### Compilation
To compile the program, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
```bash
g++ -o demo main.cpp
```

### Running the Program
After compiling the program, you can run it with the following command:
```bash
./demo
```

### Expected Output
The program will output the results of various bitwise operations performed on two integers, `a` and `b`. The expected output is as follows:
```
Bitwise AND of 5 and 3 is: 1
Bitwise OR of 5 and 3 is: 7
Bitwise XOR of 5 and 3 is: 6
Bitwise NOT of 5 is: -6
Bitwise left shift of 5 by 1 is: 10
Bitwise right shift of 5 by 1 is: 2
```
